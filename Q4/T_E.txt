Write notes explaining each type of operator in C: arithmetic, relational,
logical, assignment, increment/decrement, bitwise, and conditional operators.

Arithmetic operators  
Used to perform mathematical calculations on values.

- + (Addition): Adds two operands.  
  Example: a + b
- - (Subtraction): Subtracts the second operand from the first.  
  Example: a - b
- * (Multiplication): Multiplies both operands.  
  Example: a * b
- / (Division): Divides the numerator by the denominator.  
  Example: a / b
- % (Modulus): Gives the remainder after division.  
  Example: a % b

Relational operators  
Used for comparing values; the result is either true (1) or false (0).

- == (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.  
  Example: a == b
- != (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.  
  Example: a != b
- > (Greater than): Checks if the left value is greater.  
  Example: a > b
- = (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left value is greater or equal.  
  Example: a >= b
-  0) && (b > 0)
- || (Logical OR): True if at least one condition is true.  
  Example: (a > 0) || (b > (Right shift): Shifts bits to the right.  
  Example: a >> 1

Conditional operator (Ternary operator)
Used for conditional expressions; it is the only ternary operator in C.

- ? : (Condition ? expression1 : expression2): If the condition is true, expression1 is evaluated; otherwise, expression2.
  Example: result = (a > b) ? a : b;
