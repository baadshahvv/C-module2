Explain decision-making statements in C (if, else, nested if-else, switch).
Provide examples of each.

Decision-making statements in C let you control the flow of your program based on conditions. The main statements are if, else, nested if-else, and switch. Hereâ€™s an explanation and example for each.

if statement  
The if statement checks a condition. If the condition is true, the block of code inside executes.

Example:
```c
int number = 5;
if (number > 0) {
    printf("Number is positive\n");
}
```
If number is greater than 0, it prints "Number is positive".

if-else statement  
This lets you choose between two branches: one if the condition is true, another if it is false.

Example:
```c
int number = -3;
if (number > 0) {
    printf("Positive\n");
} else {
    printf("Not positive\n");
}
```
If number is not greater than 0, it prints "Not positive".

nested if-else statement  
You can use if-else statements inside other if-else statements to check multiple conditions.

Example:
```c
int number = 0;
if (number > 0) {
    printf("Positive\n");
} else {
    if (number == 0) {
        printf("Zero\n");
    } else {
        printf("Negative\n");
    }
}
```
This checks if number is positive, zero, or negative.

switch statement  
The switch statement is useful for selecting among many options based on the value of an integer or character expression.

Example:
```c
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        printf("Monday\n");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("Tuesday\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("Wednesday\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Other day\n");
}
```
If day is 3, it prints "Wednesday". If it doesn't match any case, "Other day" is printed.
