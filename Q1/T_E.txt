its importance and why it is still used today

History and Importance of C Programming
C was developed in 1972 at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie to improve on the B language and make programming faster, more portable, and easier than assembly. It became famous when the UNIX operating system was rewritten in C in 1973.

The first major reference, The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie (1978), led to its wide adoption. Later, ANSI C (1989) standardized it, followed by C99, C11, and C18, adding modern features like better data types, multi-threading, and safety.

C is important because it is fast, portable, and gives direct hardware control. It has influenced many languages like C++, Java, and C#.

Today, C is still used in operating systems, embedded systems, databases, and game engines because of its efficiency and reliability. Its long life proves itâ€™s one of the most important programming languages ever created.
